Here are some user stories for our smart parking app project:

1. **As a driver in a busy area**, I want to view available parking spots in real time so that I can find parking quickly and avoid wasting time searching.

2. **As a commuter**, I want to reserve a parking spot in advance so that I can ensure I have a place to park when I arrive at my destination.

3. **As a city planner**, I want to analyze parking availability data so that I can optimize parking infrastructure and reduce congestion in busy areas.

4. **As a parking facility manager**, I want to track the occupancy rate of parking spots so that I can manage space more efficiently and maximize revenue.
