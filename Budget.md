# Anticipated Budget
**Hardware Costs**
- **IoT Sensors** (e.g., ultrasonic or magnetic): $15–$50 per unit × 10 sensors = **$150–$500**
- **Microcontroller Boards** (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi): $40–$70 each × 2 boards = **$80–$140**
- **Connectivity Modules** (e.g., Wi-Fi, LoRa, or GSM): $20–$50 × 2 units = **$40–$100**
- **Power Supplies/Batteries**: $10–$20 per sensor setup × 10 = **$100–$200**
- **Cabling/Connectors/Mounts**: **$50–$100**
- **Backup Hardware for Testing/Failures**: **$50–$100**

**Subtotal for Hardware:** **$470–$1,140**
