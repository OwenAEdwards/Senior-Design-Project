## Justification

### 1. Mobile App Development & UI Integration (18 hours)  
- Designed and built the mobile frontend using Flutter and Dart in Android Studio.  
- Created intuitive UI screens for login, dashboard, and parking status view.  
- Integrated backend APIs with real-time updates using HTTP calls and state management.  
- Conducted iterative testing and enhancements to optimize UI responsiveness across devices.

### 2. Backend Development & Database Integration (12 hours)  
- Set up an ASP.NET backend in Rider to handle parking logic, user sessions, and token-based auth.  
- Developed controllers and services to interface with MongoDB using official drivers.  
- Established configuration patterns (e.g., `appsettings.json`, `MongoDbSettings`) for clean dependency injection.

### 3. Authentication Setup & Firebase OAuth (5 hours)  
- Configured Firebase project for Google OAuth.  
- Integrated Firebase Auth into Flutter, handling login, logout, and error states.  
- Verified JWT token exchange between frontend and backend to ensure secure access.

### 4. Containerization & DevOps (Docker + Compose) (4 hours)  
- Wrote Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` to containerize the ASP.NET backend and MongoDB.  
- Enabled seamless environment spin-up for development and potential deployment.  
- Addressed image build issues and ensured cross-platform compatibility.

### 5. System Simulation, Testing & Debugging (3 hours)  
- Used AVD (Android Virtual Device) for emulating and testing various use cases.  
- Debugged user flow, token expiration, and API failure scenarios.  
- Validated backend responses and MongoDB integration under simulated conditions.

### 6. Team Collaboration & Meetings (5 hours)  
- Regularly coordinated with teammate on interfacing mobile app with IoT data pipeline.  
- Contributed ideas during weekly syncs on UI/UX, system architecture, and deployment strategy.  
- Reviewed each otherâ€™s code and configurations for consistency and maintainability.

This summary outlines the key areas of work and the time dedicated to each task, with a primary focus on mobile development, database integration, and troubleshooting.
